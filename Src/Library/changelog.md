## Improvements üöÄ

<details><summary>Treat validation rules with conditions attached as optional properties in Swagger spec.</summary>

If a validation rule is conditional, like in the example below, that particular DTO property will be considered optional and will not be marked as required in the
Swagger Schema.

```csharp
RuleFor(x => x.Id) //this property will be a required property in the swagger spec
    .NotEmpty();   //because there's no 'When(...)' condition attached to it.

RuleFor(x => x.Age) //this will be an optional property in swagger spec because
    .NotEmpty()     //'NotEmpty()' is conditional.
    .When(SomeCondition);
```

For this to work, the rules have to be written separately as above. I.e. the `.When(...)` condition must proceed immediately after the `.NotEmpty()` or `.NotNull()` rule.

<details><summary>Micro optimization with 'Concurrent Dictionary' usage</summary></details>

Concurrent dictionary `GetOrAdd()` overload with lambda parameter seems to perform a bit better in .NET 8. All locations that were using the other overload was
changed to use the overload with the lambda.
