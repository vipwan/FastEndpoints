## New üéâ

<details><summary>Support for .Net 8.0</summary>

The project is now developed and built using .NET 8.0 while supporting .NET 6 & 7 as well. You can upgrade your existing projects simply by targeting .NET 8

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
    <PropertyGroup>
        <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
     </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

After changing the SDK version to `net8.0`, you may get a build/compilation error with `NSwag` not being updated for .NET 8 yet. As a temporary workaround, you can add the following to your `.csproj` until NSwag is updated:
```xml
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.Abstractions" Version="8.0.0" />
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Options" Version="8.0.0" />
```

The .NET 8 [Request Delegate Generator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/aot/request-delegate-generator/rdg?view=aspnetcore-8.0) is not yet 
compatible with FastEndpoints as FE has it's own endpoint mapping and model binding system which will require a complete rewrite as a Source Generator to properly 
support Native AOT. We're currently investigating ways to achieve that but cannot give a timeframe on completion as it's a massive undertaking.

<details><summary>Test assertions couldn't be done on ProblemDetails DTO</summary>

The `ProblemDetails` DTO properties had private setter properties preventing STJ from being able to deserialize the JSON which has now been corrected.

## Minor Breaking Changes ‚ö†Ô∏è

<details><summary>Pre/Post Processor interface changes</summary>

todo: describe the change and how to migrate

</details>

<details><summary>AddJWTBearerAuth() default claim type mapping behavior change</summary>

The `JwtSecurityTokenHandler.DefaultInboundClaimTypeMap` static dictionary is presently used by ASP.NET for mapping claim types for inbound claim type mapping. In most
cases people use `JwtSecurityTokenHandler.DefaultInboundClaimTypeMap.Clear()` to not have long claim types such
as `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/nameidentifier` as the claim type for the `sub` claim for example.

The default behavior has now been changed to make the claim types not use the SOAP type identifiers like above. If for some reason you'd like to revert to the old
behavior, it can be achieved like so:

```csharp
.AddJWTBearerAuth("jwt_signing_key", o =>
{
    o.MapInboundClaims = true;
});
```

See #526 for more info.
